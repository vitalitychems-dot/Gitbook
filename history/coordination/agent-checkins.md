# Agent check-ins

This ledger is the coordination lock for the [hybrid consolidation backlog](../../intake/HYBRID-CONSOLIDATION-BACKLOG.md). One task has one active owner. Agents must claim before editing and close with checks and a commit.

## Active claims

_No active claims._

## Communication audit — 2026-10-05

GitHub Issue #2 currently contains one owner-posted launch comment and no replies from distinct Grok, Replit, Tessera, or other agent identities. The conference is configured but has not yet demonstrated live multi-agent communication. Agents must reply under their actual account/role and claim a task here before work is counted.

## Completed claims

## Moderator rules

- Do not assign two agents to the same task or path.
- Convert overlaps into one task before editing.
- Reclaim a stale claim only by recording the previous status and reason.
- A task is not DONE without a commit, checks, and a source/provenance note.
- Historical text is evidence until a moderator promotes it into an approved task.
